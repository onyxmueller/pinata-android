## Documentation

### PinataApiResponse

`PinataApiResponse` serves as an interface designed to create consistent responses from the Pinata API. It offers convenient extensions to manage your payloads, encompassing both body data and exceptional scenarios. `PinataApiResponse` encompasses three distinct types: **Success**, **Error**, and **Exception**.

#### PinataApiResponse.Success

This represents a successful response from the Pinata API. You can create an instance of [PinataApiResponse.Success] by giving the generic type and data.

```kotlin
val apiResponse = PinataApiResponse.Success(data = myData)
val data = apiResponse.data
```

#### PinataApiResponse.Exception

This signals a failed tasks captured by unexpected exceptions during a Pinata API request creation or response processing on the client side, such as a network connection failure. You can obtain exception details from the `PinataApiResponse.Exception`.

```kotlin
val apiResponse = PinataApiResponse.Exception(exception = HttpTimeoutException())
val exception = apiResponse.exception
val message = apiResponse.message
```

#### PinataApiResponse.Error

This denotes a failed Pinata API request, typically due to bad requests or internal server errors. You can additionally put an error payload that can contain detailed error information.

```kotlin
val apiResponse = PinataApiResponse.Error(payload = errorBody)
val payload = apiResponse.payload
```
